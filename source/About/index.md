# Welcome
Welcome to the Family Shared Computing of the KLS Family Networks aka "The Home Lab." This lab consists of enterprise gear running an assortment of applications, services and projects for personal, family and business use. If you are visiting a "KLS" site, you are more then likely hitting an endpoint on one of the server or servers in this lab. The lab spans to two separate sites as well as connectivity with one or more cloud infrastructure.

## About this Project
This is a project of [Dennis Khau](https://dennisdoes.net), a former <em>system administrator</em>. It's a self-learning and self-improvement project to keep myself up-to-date on technologies and this particular field.
