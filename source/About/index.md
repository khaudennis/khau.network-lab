# Welcome
Welcome to the Family Shared Computing of the KLS Family Networks aka "The Home Lab." The lab consists of enterprise gear running in a home environment and in my case, I operate the lab like a business unit. A home lab is nothing new and many others in the IT field have their own home lab. You can see other labs on [r/HomeLab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/new).

## About this Project
This is a project of [Dennis Khau](https://dennisdoes.net), a former <em>system administrator</em>. It's a self-learning and self-improvement project to keep myself up-to-date on technologies and this particular field.
